    "$$U(z) = 1 - z^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This shear flow becomes unstable despite having no inflection point in the flow. This is in contradiction to Rayleigh's inflection point theorem, which states that a *necessary* condition (for a *sufficient* condition, see [Balmforth and Morrison (1998)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9809024.pdf)). for a shear flow in an *inviscid* fluid to become unstable, it must have a point $z_i$ with\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is a very interesting problem because the linear operator $\\mathcal{L}_{OS}$ is non-normal, that is $\\mathcal{L}_{OS}^\\dagger \\mathcal{L}_{OS} \\neq \\mathcal{L}_{OS}\\mathcal{L}_{OS}^\\dagger$. Non-normal operators can drive transient growth: even systems in which *all* eigenmodes are linearly stable and will decay to zero, arbitrary initial conditions can be amplified by large factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume perturbations take the form $u(x,z,t) = \\hat{u} e^{i\\alpha (x - ct)}$, where $c = \\omega/\\alpha$ is the wave speed. One must take care to note that $c = c_r + i c_i$. If a perturbation has $c_i > 0$, it will linearly grow. This occurs at a Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re} \\simeq 5772$, a result you can also find using `CriticalFinder` (it's actually a test problem for `eigentools`).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, as we will see below, even at $\\mathrm{Re} = 10000$, the growth rate is tiny: $c_i \\approx 3.7\\times10^{-3}$! Yet at those Reynolds numbers, channel flow is clearly unstable. How can this be?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that the *spectrum* of the Orr-Sommerfeld operator is quite misleading. Because $\\mathcal{L}_{OS}$ is non-normal, its eigenfuntions are not orthogonal. As they decay at different rates, the total amplitude of some arbitrary initial condition can **increase**!\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation was first noted in the pioneering paper by [Reddy, Schmid, and Henningson (1993)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2102271?seq=1).

    "The `Eigenproblem` object also provides a simple method to calculate pseudospectra, `calc_ps()`. Pseudospectra were originally defined for regular eigenvalue problems. In order to calculate pseudospectra for the differential-algebraic equation systems Dedalus typically provides, we use the algorithm developed by [Embree and Keeler (2017)](https://intranet.math.vt.edu/people/embree/M105501.pdf). This uses the sparse eigenvalue solver to construct an invariant subspace to approximate a regular eigenvalue problem. Typically, it requires a rather high number of modes, $k$. Here we set $k = 100$. After we construct the approximate matrix, we feed it to a standard pseudospectrum routine. This requres a set of points in the complex plane at which the pseudospectrum will be computed. We do that by choosing a set of real and imaginary points, and feeding them to the `EP.calc_ps()` method. "
