    "# Orr Sommerfeld pseudospectra\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use the classic Orr-Sommerfeld problem to explore *pseudospectra* with Dedalus. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Orr-Sommerfeld problem explores the stability of flow down a rectangular channel driven by a pressure gradient. The equilibrium solution is known analytically as Plane Poiseuille flow, and is given by \n",
    "\n",
    "$$U(z) = 1 - z^2.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Orr and Sommerfeld noted that this becomes unstable despite having no inflection point in the flow. This means that the viscosity itself is the source of the instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very interesting problem because the linear operator $\\mathcal{L}_{OS}$ is not normal, that is $\\mathcal{L}_{OS}^\\dagger \\mathcal{L}_{OS} \\neq \\mathcal{L}_{OS}\\mathcal{L}_{OS}^\\dagger$. This means it can have transient growth: even systems in which *all* modes are linearly stable (that is, they will eventually decay) can grow to rather large amplitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume perturbations take the form $u(x,z,t) = \\hat{u} e^{i\\alpha (x - ct)}$, where $c = \\omega/\\alpha$ is the wave speed. One must take care to note that $c = c_r + i c_i$. If a perturbation has $c_i > 0$, it will linearly grow. This occurs at a Reynolds number $\\mathrm{Re} \\simeq 5775$, a result you can also find using `eigentools` (it's actually a test problem).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Reddy, Schmid, and Henningson (1993) noted that even at $\\mathrm{Re} = 10000$, the growth rate is tiny: $c_i \\approx 3.7\\times10^{-3}$! Yet at those Reynolds numbers, channel flow is very turbulent. How can this be?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is that the *spectrum* of the Orr-Sommerfeld operator is quite misleading. Because $\\mathcal{L}_{OS}$ is non-normal, its eigenfuntions are not orthogonal. As they decay at different rates, the total amplitude of some arbitrary initial condition can **increase**!"
