abstract = "We derive formulas and algorithms for Kitaev’s invariants in the periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors for finite disordered systems on lattices with boundaries. We find that K-theory arises as an obstruction to perturbing approximately compatible observables into compatible observables. We derive formulas in all symmetry classes up to dimension two, and in one symmetry class in dimension three, that can be computed with sparse matrix algorithms. We present algorithms in two symmetry classes in 2D and one in 3D and provide illustrative studies regarding how these algorithms can detect the scaling properties of phase transitions."
