abstract = "We derive formulas and algorithms for Kitaev’s invariants in the periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors for finite disordered systems on lattices with boundaries. We find that K-theory arises as an obstruction to perturbing approximately compatible observables into compatible observables. We derive formulas in all symmetry classes up to dimension two, and in one symmetry class in dimension three, that can be computed with sparse matrix algorithms. We present algorithms in two symmetry classes in 2D and one in 3D and provide illustrative studies regarding how these algorithms can detect the scaling properties of phase transitions."

abstract = {Abstract In this study, Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT) is used to explore changes in the career intentions of students in an undergraduate research experience (URE) program at a large public minority-serving college. Our URE model addresses the challenges of establishing an undergraduate research program within an urban, commuter, underfunded, Minority-Serving Institution (MSI). However, our model reaches beyond a focus on retention and remediation toward scholarly contributions and shifted career aspirations. From a student's first days at the College to beyond their graduation, we have encouraged them to explore their own potential as scientists in a coordinated, sequential, and self-reflective process. As a result, while the program's graduates have traditionally pursued entry-level STEM jobs, graduates participating in mentored research are increasingly focused on professional and academic STEM career tracks involving post-graduate study. In addition to providing an increasingly expected experience and building students’ skills, participation in undergraduate research is seen to have a transformative effect on career ambitions for many students at MSIs. While undergraduate research is often thought of in context of majority-serving institutions, we propose that it serves as a powerful equalizer at MSIs. Building on the institutional characteristics that drive diversity, our students produce scholarly work and pursue graduate degrees, in order to address the long-standing under-representation of minorities in the sciences. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

    abstract = { A wide range of experimental systems including gliding, swarming and swimming bacteria, in vitro motility assays, and shaken granular media are commonly described as self-propelled rods. Large ensembles of those entities display a large variety of self-organized, collective phenomena, including the formation of moving polar clusters, polar and nematic dynamic bands, mobility-induced phase separation, topological defects, and mesoscale turbulence, among others. Here, we give a brief survey of experimental observations and review the theoretical description of self-propelled rods. Our focus is on the emergent pattern formation of ensembles of dry self-propelled rods governed by short-ranged, contact mediated interactions and their wet counterparts that are also subject to long-ranged hydrodynamic flows. Altogether, self-propelled rods provide an overarching theme covering many aspects of active matter containing well-explored limiting cases. Their collective behavior not only bridges the well-studied regimes of polar self-propelled particles and active nematics, and includes active phase separation, but also reveals a rich variety of new patterns. }
